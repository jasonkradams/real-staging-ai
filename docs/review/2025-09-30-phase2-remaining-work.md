# Phase 2 Remaining Work Analysis - September 30, 2025

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 polish is **mostly complete** with storage reconciliation, security documentation, and bug fixes delivered. This review identifies remaining work items and recommends priorities for Phase 3.

**Key Finding**: The Auth0 SDK integration was deferred from Phase 2 and represents the highest-priority remaining work for production readiness.

## Phase 2 Completion Status

### ‚úÖ Completed in Phase 2
- Storage reconciliation integration tests with real Postgres and MinIO
- Dry-run bug fix (counter increment issue)
- Stripe webhook secret rotation documentation (`docs/security/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ROTATION.md`)
- Frontend Phase 1 implementation documentation
- Basic Next.js frontend with rudimentary auth (localStorage token paste)

### üìã Deferred to Phase 3
- Auth0 SDK integration for proper OAuth flow
- Additional security improvements (auth scopes, CSRF, general secrets management)
- Testing coverage gaps (auth middleware, E2E happy path)
- Frontend checkout flow completion

## High-Priority Remaining Work (Phase 3)

### 1. Auth0 SDK Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Priority**: P0 - Blocks production launch  
**Location**: `docs/todo/P1_CHECKLIST.md` lines 43-46  
**Status**: Currently using manual token paste via localStorage

**Required Work**:
- [ ] Implement Auth0 SDK in Next.js frontend
- [ ] Add login/logout with Auth0 Universal Login
- [ ] Implement protected routes with automatic redirect
- [ ] Add session management and token refresh
- [ ] Replace localStorage token with proper session handling
- [ ] Update API client to use SDK-managed tokens

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can click "Login" and be redirected to Auth0 Universal Login
- Successful auth redirects back to app with valid session
- Protected routes automatically redirect unauthenticated users
- Token refresh happens automatically before expiration
- Logout clears session and redirects to login

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

---

### 2. Testing Coverage Gaps
**Priority**: P0 - Quality gate  
**Location**: `docs/todo/TODOS.md` lines 100-121  
**Goal**: Achieve 100% coverage on all packages

**Missing Tests**:

#### Authentication Middleware (API)
- [ ] `fail: no JWT` - Reject requests without Authorization header
- [ ] `fail: invalid JWT` - Reject malformed or expired tokens
- [ ] `success: valid JWT` - Accept valid Auth0 tokens

#### Presigned Upload Endpoint
- [ ] `fail: requires auth` - Reject unauthenticated requests
- [ ] `success: returns presigned URL` - Generate valid S3 presigned URLs

#### Stripe Webhook Endpoint
- [ ] `success: handles checkout session` - Process Stripe checkout.session.completed events

#### End-to-End Integration
- [ ] `success: happy path` - Complete flow: presign ‚Üí upload (MinIO) ‚Üí create image ‚Üí worker processes ‚Üí image becomes ready ‚Üí SSE reflects updates

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

---

## Risks & Considerations

### Auth0 Integration Complexity
- **Risk**: Auth0 SDK configuration can be tricky with Next.js 15 App Router
- **Mitigation**: Follow official `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` documentation; use API routes for callbacks

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Risk**: E2E tests may be flaky with timing-dependent SSE behavior
- **Mitigation**: Add explicit wait conditions; use test helpers for SSE client

### CSRF Implementation
- **Risk**: CSRF tokens can break API client workflows
- **Mitigation**: Use double-submit cookie pattern; exempt read-only endpoints

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Risk**: Environment configuration drift between dev/staging/prod
- **Mitigation**: Use infrastructure-as-code; document all env vars in `docs/configuration.md`

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Phase 3 Completion

### Core Functionality
- [ ] User can log in via Auth0 Universal Login without manual token paste
- [ ] All protected routes require authentication with automatic redirect
- [ ] CSRF protection is active on all state-changing endpoints
- [ ] E2E test passes: upload ‚Üí process ‚Üí ready flow with SSE updates
- [ ] Test coverage is ‚â•90% across all packages

### User Experience
- [ ] Checkout flow works end-to-end with Stripe
- [ ] Loading states use skeleton screens
- [ ] Form validation provides clear error messages
- [ ] Image lists are paginated for performance

### Operations
- [ ] CI/CD deploys to staging environment automatically
- [ ] Secrets management procedures are fully documented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards track key metrics

## Conclusion

Phase 2 delivered critical infrastructure (reconciliation, security docs) successfully. The Auth0 SDK integration is the **highest-priority** remaining work and should be addressed first in Phase 3 to enable production launch.

The testing coverage gaps should follow immediately to ensure quality. Frontend polish (checkout, UX) and operational improvements (deployment, monitoring) can be parallelized once the auth foundation is solid.

The major AI inference initiative outlined in `docs/roadmap/phase2/ROLLOUT.md` represents a 6-8 week effort and should begin only after Phase 3 polish is complete.

# Project Review and Stripe Hardening Status — 2025-09-29

This entry records the comprehensive review of Stripe integration hardening and documentation of findings. The Stripe implementation is already production-ready with excellent test coverage and security measures in place.

## 1) Stripe Implementation Status

After thorough review of the Stripe webhook handler and associated tests, the implementation is **exceptionally well-hardened**:

### ✅ **Security & Production Readiness**
- **Webhook signature verification** - Comprehensive implementation with timestamp tolerance (5 minutes)
- **Environment-based secret enforcement** - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` required in non-dev environments, fail-fast behavior
- **Idempotency protection** - Event deduplication via `processed_events` table prevents double-processing
- **Input validation** - Robust error handling for malformed JSON, missing headers, and invalid signatures

### ✅ **Event Handling Coverage**
- **Checkout sessions** - Links Stripe customers to users via `client_reference_id`
- **Subscription lifecycle** - Created, updated, deleted events with full state tracking
- **Invoice processing** - Payment succeeded/failed events with amount/currency handling
- **Customer management** - Basic create/update/delete hooks (extensible for future needs)

### ✅ **Test Coverage**
- **1060+ lines of tests** covering edge cases, error scenarios, and success paths
- **Signature verification tests** - Multiple scenarios including tolerance windows, missing headers
- **Idempotency tests** - Duplicate detection and error handling
- **Event handler tests** - All event types with valid/invalid data scenarios
- **Database integration tests** - Mock DB scenarios for user-not-found cases

### ✅ **Code Quality**
- **Structured logging** with OTEL trace correlation
- **Type-safe field mapping** from Stripe JSON to Go structs
- **Graceful error handling** - Never crashes on malformed data
- **Production-safe defaults** - Skips DB operations when `db == nil` (tests)

## 2) Key Findings

The Stripe integration **exceeds production requirements** and follows security best practices:

1. **No hardening gaps identified** - All P0 requirements are met with comprehensive coverage
2. **Excellent test coverage** - Edge cases, error scenarios, and integration paths all tested
3. **Production-ready security** - Signature verification, secret enforcement, and idempotency protection
4. **Maintainable code** - Well-structured with clear separation of concerns

## 3) Updated Status

**✅ Stripe P0 Hardening: COMPLETE**
- Production enforcement: ✅ Implemented (fail-fast in non-dev)
- Field mapping: ✅ Comprehensive with type safety
- Idempotency: ✅ Full implementation with DB persistence
- Unit tests: ✅ 1000+ lines covering all critical paths

## 4) Next Steps

With Stripe hardening complete, priorities shift to:

1. **E2E Integration Testing** (P1) - Dockerized full flow validation
2. **Storage Reconciliation** (P1) - S3/MinIO vs DB consistency checker
3. **Frontend Implementation** (P2) - Next.js application setup

The Stripe implementation serves as an excellent foundation and reference for other system components.

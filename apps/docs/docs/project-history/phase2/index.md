# Phase 2 Planning

Production hardening and feature expansion for Real Staging AI.

## Overview

Phase 2 built upon Phase 1's foundation with enhanced features, better error handling, and production optimizations.

## Goals

1. **Multi-upload support** - Handle batch uploads efficiently
2. **Model registry** - Support multiple AI models
3. **Production hardening** - Enhanced error handling and retries
4. **Performance** - Optimize database queries and job processing
5. **Developer experience** - Better testing tools and documentation

## Key Features

### Multi-Upload System

Upload up to 50 images in a single batch with:
- Individual settings per image
- Default configuration fallback
- Parallel presigned URL generation
- Optimized job enqueueing

[Implementation details →](../../implementation-notes/multi-upload.md)

### Model Registry

Flexible system for managing multiple AI models:
- Plugin architecture for models
- Per-model input builders
- Metadata and versioning
- Easy model addition

[Implementation details →](../../implementation-notes/staging-model-registry.md)

### Configuration System

Migrated to structured YAML configuration:
- Environment-specific configs
- Secrets separation
- Validation on startup
- Better defaults

[Implementation details →](../../implementation-notes/configuration-migration.md)

## Implementation Status

✅ Multi-upload API endpoints  
✅ Batch job creation  
✅ Model registry system  
✅ Qwen and Flux models  
✅ YAML configuration  
✅ Enhanced error messages  
✅ Improved test coverage  
✅ Worker optimizations  

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

✅ Model registry pattern - Easy to add new models  
✅ Batch operations - Significant UX improvement  
✅ YAML configs - Much cleaner than env vars  
✅ Input builders - Clean separation of concerns  

### Challenges

⚠️ Batch operations complexity - Many edge cases  
⚠️ Model API differences - Each model has unique requirements  
⚠️ Configuration migration - Needed careful backward compatibility  

## Metrics

### Performance Improvements
- Batch upload: 10x faster than sequential
- Job enqueueing: 50% faster with batching
- Config load time: <5ms (vs 50ms with env parsing)

### Code Quality
- Test coverage: 85% → 90%
- Lines of code: +5,000
- New API endpoints: 3
- New models supported: 2

## Next Steps

Phase 3 focused on:
- Frontend development
- Real-time features
- User experience enhancements
- Mobile responsiveness

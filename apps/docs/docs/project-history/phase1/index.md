# Phase 1 Planning

Initial architecture and implementation planning for Real Staging AI.

## Overview

Phase 1 established the foundation of Real Staging AI with core functionality needed for a production-ready virtual staging service.

## Goals

1. **Validate the concept** - Prove AI staging works end-to-end
2. **Build solid foundation** - Architecture that scales
3. **Production ready** - Not just a prototype
4. **Test-driven** - Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Observable** - Full instrumentation from day one

## Architecture Documents

### [API Design](api.md)
RESTful API design, OpenAPI specification, endpoint planning

### [Architecture](architecture.md)
System architecture, service interactions, component design

### [Authentication](auth.md)
Auth0 integration, JWT validation, user management

### [Queue Design](queue.md)
Redis-based job queue with Asynq, retry logic, dead letter queue

### [S3 Storage](s3.md)
Presigned URL strategy, bucket structure, security

### [Database Schema](schema.md)
PostgreSQL schema design, relationships, migrations

### [Security](security.md)
Security considerations, threat model, mitigation strategies

### [Observability](observability.md)
OpenTelemetry integration, metrics, traces, logs

### [Setup](setup.md)
Development environment setup, configuration management

### [Stripe Integration](stripe.md)
Payment processing, subscription management, webhooks

## Key Decisions

### Technology Choices

**Go for Backend**
- Performance requirements
- Concurrency model
- Strong typing
- Simple deployment

**PostgreSQL for Database**
- ACID compliance needed for billing
- JSON support for flexible data
- Mature ecosystem
- Excellent query performance

**Redis for Queue**
- Reliable job queue
- Pub/sub for SSE
- Fast in-memory operations

**Auth0 for Authentication**
- Managed service
- Industry standard (OAuth 2.0 / OIDC)
- Social login support
- MFA built-in

**Replicate for AI**
- No GPU infrastructure needed
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Fast inference
- Multiple models available

### Architectural Patterns

**Microservices (Lightweight)**
- API service handles HTTP requests
- Worker service processes jobs
- Services communicate via Redis
- Each scales independently

**Repository Pattern**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable data access
- SQL generation with sqlc

**Test-Driven Development**
- Tests before implementation
- Unit and integration tests
- High coverage targets

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1a: Foundation
- [x] Project setup
- [x] Database schema
- [x] Migrations
- [x] Basic API structure
- [x] Health checks

### Phase 1b: Authentication
- [x] Auth0 integration
- [x] JWT middleware
- [x] User creation
- [x] Token validation

### Phase 1c: Core Features
- [x] Project CRUD
- [x] Image CRUD
- [x] S3 presigned uploads
- [x] Job queueing

### Phase 1d: Worker
- [x] Job processing
- [x] Replicate integration
- [x] Status updates
- [x] Error handling

### Phase 1e: Billing
- [x] Stripe integration
- [x] Subscription management
- [x] Webhook handling
- [x] Invoice tracking

### Phase 1f: Observability
- [x] OpenTelemetry setup
- [x] Traces
- [x] Metrics
- [x] Structured logging

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

✅ **Test-driven development** - Caught bugs early, improved design  
✅ **sqlc for database** - Type-safe SQL, fast queries  
✅ **Asynq for jobs** - Reliable, built-in retries  
✅ **Presigned URLs** - Avoid proxying large files  
✅ **OpenTelemetry** - Excellent observability from day one  

### Challenges

⚠️ **Auth0 learning curve** - JWT validation initially complex  
⚠️ **Stripe webhooks** - Idempotency and signature verification tricky  
⚠️ **Redis pub/sub for SSE** - Required careful connection management  
⚠️ **Worker error handling** - Many edge cases with external APIs  

### Would Do Differently

- Start with more comprehensive error codes
- Add admin endpoints earlier
- Document API decisions as we go
- Set up staging environment sooner

## Metrics

### Development Time
- **Planning**: 2 weeks
- **Implementation**: 8 weeks
- **Testing & Polish**: 2 weeks
- **Total**: ~12 weeks

### Code Statistics
- **Lines of Go**: ~15,000
- **Test Coverage**: 85%
- **API Endpoints**: 25+
- **Database Tables**: 8

### Performance
- **API P95 latency**: <500ms
- **Job processing**: ~9s per image
- **Database queries**: <50ms average

## Next Phase

Phase 1 delivered a working product. Phase 2 focused on:

- Production hardening
- Multi-upload support
- Model registry
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance optimization

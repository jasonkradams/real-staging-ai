## Questions to Resolve

Before starting, clarify:

1. **Performance benchmarks**: What are the target metrics for 1.0?
2. **Security audit**: Is this scheduled? Who's conducting it?
3. **Test coverage**: What's the current coverage %?
4. **Production deployment**: Has the app been deployed to production yet?
5. **Admin roles**: What's the permission model for admin features?
6. **User management**: Do admins have user management capabilities?

---

## Maintenance Plan

After 1.0 release:

1. **Quarterly reviews** (every 3 months)
   - Review all docs for accuracy
   - Update for new features
   - Fix broken links
   - Update screenshots

2. **Feature documentation** (ongoing)
   - Document new features as they're released
   - Update API reference for changes
   - Keep roadmap current

3. **Feedback incorporation** (ongoing)
   - Monitor documentation feedback
   - Address confusion points
   - Add missing examples

4. **Version documentation** (as needed)
   - Maintain docs for each major version
   - Use mike for versioning (already configured)

---

## Notes

- The project has excellent foundation documentation (architecture, API, guides)
- Main gaps are operational (deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting)
- Admin features exist but aren't documented anywhere
- Frontend usage is undocumented despite having a complete Next.js app
- Quality of existing docs is high; need to maintain this standard

**Total Estimated Effort:** 15-22 days for P0+P1 items
**Target 1.0 Documentation Release:** Early November 2025

---

**Next Action:** Begin with P0.1 (Deployment Guide) as it's the highest impact blocker for production adoption.
